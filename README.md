Potato Leaf Disease Classification

This project represents a comprehensive approach to Potato Leaf Disease Classification by harnessing Deep Learning techniques, specifically CNN (Convolution Neural Network) architectures implemented through TensorFlow. The project encompasses the development of a user-friendly application employing React JS for web-based functionality and React Native for mobile devices. This technology caters directly to the agricultural domain, offering crucial support to potato farmers who frequently encounter challenges due to diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight affecting their crops.

Project Objectives:
The primary objective is to create an intuitive interface allowing farmers to capture leaf images effortlessly. Through this interface, the application identifies and categorizes the type of disease present on the leaf. This real-time disease detection capability is pivotal for farmers as it aids in timely intervention, enabling them to apply necessary treatments promptly. By addressing diseases at their onset, the project aims to minimize economic losses and decrease wastage in potato cultivation.

Development Process:

Data Collection: Comprehensive gathering of a diverse dataset comprising potato leaf images showcasing various stages and types of diseases.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring dataset uniformity and readiness for effective analysis. This involves tasks such as standardization, noise reduction, and labeling.

Data Augmentation: Enhancing dataset diversity through techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to amplify the model's ability to generalize across various conditions.

Model Building: Constructing a robust CNN architecture tailored for disease classification based on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters, optimizing hyperparameters, and employing techniques like transfer learning to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Creation of Frontend Applications: Developing seamless and intuitive user interfaces for both web and mobile platforms. These interfaces enable users to capture leaf images effortlessly and receive rapid disease predictions.

Model Deployment: Uploading the trained model onto the application's backend infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration for real-time disease prediction.

Predicting Output: Empowering users to capture leaf images through the application and receive immediate disease predictions, aiding in timely decision-making for agricultural interventions.

Model Performance:
The implemented CNN model showcases commendable performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96% after 20 epochs and demonstrating significant improvement to around 99.7% after 50 epochs. The iterative increase in epoch count correlates with enhanced accuracy, ensuring a more precise disease classification.

Impact:
This technology offers a substantial advantage to farmers by facilitating early disease detection. Equipped with this tool, farmers can proactively address diseases, thereby safeguarding crop health and mitigating financial losses, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.
